# Hi 👋 This is Amir!
#### Newbie programmer/developer interested in programs and codes 🧑‍💻

## About me 🟩
A student close to graduating in a different area of study than coding </>

I enjoy coding, so I have not stopped coding and enjoy designing and my current situation.

At the moment, I am taking the next step to learn Python programming language effectively. I have learned this and other programming languages before, but not in the correct order.

Until now, I have not concentrated on a career objective. I am just following the educational process 📕

And, more important, I will graduate soon, so I do not have much time for this, but I will do my best 🎯

It's not all. It's a short way to introduce myself, because I don't have much thing to present, for now ...
I will create some project here as soon as possible, and thanks for your support ☺️
